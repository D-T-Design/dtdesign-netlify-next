# David Torres Portfolio - Built with NextJS, Netlify, and Sanity

My design and development portfolio, custom built using Next and Sanity, deployed via Netlify.

## The goals of this project are:
- Develop a portfolio using modern technology such as Single-Page Applications and JAMStack principles.
- Set up site for SEO success by integrating page pre-rendering and following web standards for search optimization.
- Include external data fetching and CMS integration with Sanity and Next integration.
- Display design skills with a unique design and clean aesthetic

I will be posting my progress here and the final site will be deployed via Netlify with continuous deployment from GitHub.

### A little about me:

My background is in the graphic design & print media industry, however I have always been coding and wrote my first line of HTML over 15 years ago!  The current website I am using for my personal site was designed as a "graphic designer freelancer" website, however this no longer aligns with my goals.  To correct this, I am revamping the site as an interactive resume and including Web Design and Development as the dominant skills being displayed.

Build started via [Next-Netlify-Starter](https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-starter).
